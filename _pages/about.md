Hi there! I'm Yaswanth (Yash), fifth year Ph.D. student in School of Computing, National University of Singapore. I work full-time on exploring tools to acceleate power side-channel evaluations supervised by [Prof. Li Shiuan Peh](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~peh/) and [Prof. Trevor E. Carlson](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tcarlson/). My other research interests include secure systems, processor architectures, deep learning accelerators, and lower power systems. 

In the past I worked on in-memory computing with [Prof. Anupam Chattopadhyay](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01076), Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I earned my MSc in Electronics at NTU and my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at KLUniversity.

Mine and my collaborators' research was published at Frontiers, TC, T-ITS, TACO, TRETS. Refer to publications tab for more details. I had brief stints at Wipro Technologies @ Pune-India, Hardware and Embedded Systems Lab and Energy Research Instituite @ NTU-Singapore, BMW Advanced Mobility Lab @ NTU-Singapore, Institute of Microelectronics @ A*STAR-Singapore, Electronic Design Automation Lab @ PoLiTO-Italy, Vicharak @ Surat-Inda.
