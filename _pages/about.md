Hi there! I'm Yaswanth (Yash), fifth year Ph.D. student in School of Computing, National University of Singapore. I work full-time on exploring tools to acceleate power side-channel evaluations supervised by Prof. Li Shiuan Peh and Prof. Trevor E. Carlson. My other research interests include secure systems, processor architectures, deep learning accelerators, and lower power systems.
